# HW2_Programming_700788005
# Description
This repository contains three jupyter notebooks that apply machine learning algorithms which is performed on the Iris datasets, focuses on classification using Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms. Its main goal is to explore model behavior, performance and accuracy using different techniques. 
# Q7_DecisionTreeIris file:
It is a decision tree classification on Iris Dataset. It loads and preprocesses the dataset, trains a Decision Tree classifier, evaluates the model’s performance, and also analyzes how the tree splits features to classify different flower species. Its main objective is to understand how Decision Trees perform on a multi-class dataset.
# Q8_KNNClassificationIris:
It is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to the Iris dataset. Here, it selects a value for k, trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the accuracy and classification results. Its main objective is to apply KNN and observe how distance-based classification works.
# Q9_KNNPerformanceIris:
It analyzes the performance of KNN by testing multiple values of k. It compares the performance of different neighbor values, visualizes accuracy versus k, and helps to determine the optimal number of neighbors. Its main objective is to study how the value of k impacts model performance.
# Datasets used in this project
Here, this project uses Iris dataset provided by sklearn.datasets. The dataset includes four features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. And the flower species are classified into three classes and they are Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
# Objective:
This project provides an understanding of Decision Tree and KNN classification, learn how to compare model performance, analyze hyperparameters, visualize classification accuracy, and the complete machine learning workflow.
